Nango lets you create custom integrations through code. Unlike pre-built integrations, custom integrations provide the flexibility to address unique or complex requirements.

# Key concepts

**Code-defined integrations**
- Define integrations with code, offering full customization capabilities.
- Integrate with any API, adapting to specific use cases and data requirements.

**Integration-specific tooling**
- Utilize tools designed to simplify and maintain the integration code (e.g. rate limits, pagination, etc.).
- Ensure code quality and manageability without compromising on flexibility.

**Integration execution and management**
- Integration scripts are executed on Nango's infrastructure, enabling observability, scalability, and manageability.
- Leverage multiple Nango environments to streamline the deployment process

**Development workflow**
- Develop and test integrations in your local environment using familiar tools and practices.
- Use Git for version control, integrating your integration code into your existing codebase management workflow.

# Benefits of custom integrations
- **Flexibility**: Tailor integrations to the exact requirements of your application and the external APIs you wish to connect with.
- **Development Speed**: Reduce the time from concept to deployment, enabling your team to ship integrations faster.
- **Scalability**: Leverage Nango's infrastructure to scale your integrations as your application grows.
- **Observability**: Gain insights into the performance and health of your integrations through Nango's monitoring tools.
- **Manageability**: Nango's UI & API allows fine-grained control of the execution of your integrations.
