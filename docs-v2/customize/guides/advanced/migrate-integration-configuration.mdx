Nango created a new integration configuration (`nango.yaml`) schema in February 2024. Learn about its [benefits](/understand/concepts/scripts#integration-configuration).

To migrate to it: 
- update the Nango CLI to the latest version
- in your `nango-integration` folder, run `nango migrate-config` (a success message should appear)
- deploy your integrations with `nango deploy <env>`
