External APIs often enforce rate limits to prevent excessive use. When these limits are reached, you'll start receiving HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` errors, blocking further requests until the limit resets.

To maintain data freshness and avoid disruptions in your [integration scripts](/understand/concepts/scripts), it's crucial to manage your API call volume and handle rate limits effectively. Nango simplifies this process significantly.

## Strategy 1: Retry with exponential backoff

The simplest strategy involves retrying failed requests after waiting:

When you configure HTTP requests using Nango's helper ([reference](/reference/scripts#http-requests)), you can specify the number of retries:

```ts
await nango.get({ endpoint: '/some-endpoint', retries: 10 });
```

This configuration enables automatic retries on receiving a `429` status code, with the retries spaced out using exponential backoff. This method is efficient because:

- It uses exponential backoff to wait out the rate-limit period.
- Nango [syncs](/understand/concepts/syncs) can run for up to 24 hours, allowing retries to occur within this window (note that action and webhook scripts have shorter lifespans, see [Resource Limits](/reference/limits)).
- It works for APIs, without requiring any API-specific configurations

## Strategy 2: Leverage rate-limit headers

Most of the time, the 1st strategy is sufficient to handle rate limits. 

For APIs with stringent limits, Nango provides a more refined and customized approach by automatically parsing API-specific rate-limit headers from responses and scheduling retries only after the rate limit period has reset:

This is set up in the same way as the first strategy:

```ts
await nango.get({ endpoint: '/some-endpoint', retries: 10 });
```


If rate-limit headers are not already configured for an API you are using, you can request their inclusion by reaching out to the Nango team via the [community](https://nango.dev/slack) â€” typically within 24 hours.
