Nango publishes [integration templates](/understand/concepts/templates) for the most popular APIs & use cases. Templates are a starting point for your custom integrations to reuse and extend.

Here is the [list of publicly available integration templates](/integrations/overview).

You can activate template integrations directly in the Nango UI to get started fast. But if you want to edit their code or configuration, you must pull them in your [integrations folder](/understand/concepts/scripts#integration-folder) as described below.

<Info>
Pre-requisite: set up an integrations folder ([step-by-step guide](/customize/guides/setup)).
</Info>

# Download the template code

Download the template code locally. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NangoHQ/integration-templates/tree/main/integrations) or directly in the Nango UI in the _Endpoints_ tab of an integration.

# Copy/paste the integration configuration & scripts

Copy/paste the necessary configuration from the `nango.yaml` file of the template folder into your own `nango.yaml` configuration (in your `nango-integrations` folder).

Copy/paste the necessary integration script files (ending in `.ts`) from the template folder into your `nango-integrations` folder.

There is no need to copy/paste the `models.ts` file from the template folder; it is a generated file that will be regenerated separately in your integrations folder when you run `nango dev`.

# Customize the template at will

Edit the `nango.yaml` configuration and integration scripts as you see fit ([step-by-step guide](/customize/guides/create-a-custom-integration)).

<Warning>
If a custom integration script name conflicts with a template name, the custom integration script will override the template in the Nango UI.
</Warning>
