## API gotchas

In your Nango connection config, you need to specify the EvaluAgent region that is being used. This can be one of the following options:

- api - For use with the EvaluAgent EU region
- api.us-east - For use with the EvaluAgent US-East region
- api.aus - For use with the EvaluAgent Australia region

This API does require an active EvaluAgent subscription.
