## API gotchas
- Each Coupa Compass customer has their own base url, of the form `{instance_name}.coupahost.com`. For example: `companyname.coupahost.com`, which is the `{instanceDomain}`.
- Coupa Compass offers various API types, each with its own base URL. To determine your endpoint structure, please refer to the specific API type. For example, the CSO API uses `cso.coupahost.com/api/`, while the Coupa Core API uses `{instanceDomain}/api`
