## API gotchas

-   When using `vimeo-basic` authentication, add your app `client_id` as the username and `client_secret` as the password.
-   Vimeo enforces different rate limits based on the membership level. For more details check [Vimeo rate limits](https://developer.vimeo.com/guidelines/rate-limiting)
