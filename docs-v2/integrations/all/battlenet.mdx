## Connection configuration in Nango

Battlenet uses different domain extensions for different regions.

You need to pass the domain extension to use to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('battlenet', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {extension: 'com.cn'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

-   Tokens cannot be refreshed, hence when the token expires, resource owners will have to go through the authorize flow again.
