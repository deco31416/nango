## API gotchas

- kustomer uses API_KEY auth mode with Authorization: Bearer `api_key` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- Depending on the pricing plan, there are various rate limits.
- kustomer uses different domain extensions for different regions, i.e `api` for US Hosted Customers. For EU based clients, add `api.prod2` as your extension.
