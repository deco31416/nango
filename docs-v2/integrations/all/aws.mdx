## Connection configuration in Nango

AWS uses different domain extensions codes for different regions, i.e `us-east-2` for the US East (Ohio) region, `us-east-1` for the US East (N. Virginia) region, or `eu-west-1` for Europe (Ireland) region.It also uses different subdomains for different `user pools`.
