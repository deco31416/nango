## Free Self-Hosting

The same features that are free on Cloud, (O)Auth for all APIs Nango supports, are also available for free self-hosted instances.

Check the sidebar for guides on setting up your self-hosted Nango instance on [AWS](/host/self-host/aws), [GCP](/host/self-host/gcp) or [locally](/host/self-host/local)

## Paid Self-Hosting

All paid features available on Nango Cloud are also available on the paid self-hosted version. A [Scale plan](https://www.nango.dev/pricing) subscription is required.

Paid self-hosting is optimized for large, regulated Enterprises.

If you are interested in the paid self-hosting version, please get in touch with us in the [community](https://nango.dev/slack) or [book a demo](https://nango.dev/chat).
